# Demo Guide

This guide walks you through running the Intelligent Data Quality Platform in
demo mode and exploring its features. The demo seeds a synthetic dataset
containing deliberately missing values and runs a simple completeness rule so
that you can observe incidents being created in real time.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- `make` (typically available on Linux/macOS; on Windows install via WSL or
  the GNU toolchain)

## Running the demo

From the root of the repository, execute:

```bash
make demo
```

Docker Compose will build the backend and frontend images, start Postgres,
Prometheus and Grafana, seed the database and launch a small synthetic data
generator. Once the services have started (watch the logs in the console),
open your browser and navigate to:

- <http://localhost:5173> for the UI
- <http://localhost:8000/docs> for the backend OpenAPI documentation
- <http://localhost:9090> for Prometheus
- <http://localhost:3000> for Grafana (default credentials: `admin`/`admin`)

## Exploring the UI

1. **Log in** using one of the seeded users:
   - Owner: `owner@example.com` / `Passw0rd!`
   - Reviewer: `reviewer@example.com` / `Passw0rd!`
   - Viewer: `viewer@example.com` / `Passw0rd!`
2. After logging in you will land on the **Overview** page. It displays a
   summary of incidents by severity and the pass rate of recent checks.
3. Navigate to the **Incidents** page via the sidebar. You should see at
   least one incident generated by the completeness rule on the synthetic
   dataset. Click on a row to open the detail drawer. The drawer shows the
   metric value that triggered the rule, a description of the violation and
   allows you to **Acknowledge** the incident. Try acknowledging it and
   observe that the acknowledged status updates in the list.
4. Go to the **Rules** page and click **Create Rule**. Use the form to
   define a new completeness rule on the `sample_dataset` with a tighter
   threshold (e.g. 0.05). Save the rule and wait for the next run of the
   quality job (or manually run `make spark-job` in another terminal). The
   new rule will appear in the list and any violations will show up on the
   **Incidents** page.

## Triggering failures

To see different types of incidents you can modify the synthetic data or
adjust rule thresholds:

- Edit `scripts/generate_synthetic_data.py` to inject additional missing
  values, duplicates or outliers.
- Create rules of type `uniqueness` or `freshness` via the **Rules** page.
- Run the job manually with `make spark-job` to process the latest data.

## Cleaning up

When you are finished exploring the demo, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal
running `make demo` or execute:

```bash
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml down -v
```

This will shut down all containers and remove volumes including the seeded
Postgres database.

Enjoy exploring your data quality metrics!
